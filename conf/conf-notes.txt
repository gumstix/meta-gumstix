The included meta-gumstix layer makes the "overo", "duovero", and "pepper"
machines available.  By default, MACHINE=overo but this can readily
overridden, for example:

    $ MACHINE=duovero bitbake core-image-base

To (re-)build just the bootloader or kernel, use these commands:

    $ bitbake virtual/bootloader
    $ bitbake virtual/kernel

See https://github.com/gumstix/yocto-manifest for more details.
