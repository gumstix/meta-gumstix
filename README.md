Yocto BSP layer for Gumstix products. 

This repository is developed in the environment provided by the
[Gumstix Yocto manifest][yocto-manifest] repository.  New code is
developed on the *next* branch corresponding to the *dev* branch of the
manifest and, when appropriate, merged back into the current release
branch called out by the *master* branch of the manifest. Older
releases are tagged by name in the manifest repository and use the
release-specific branches found in this repository.

This repository is discussed on the [Gumstix Mailing List][mailing-list]
and feature-requests/issues can be raised against the top-level
[manifest][yocto-manifest] project.
